\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}
The purpose of this project was to discover and work on different neural network models in order to solve an image classification problem. Specifically the recognition of chihuahuas from muffins, which because of the similarities, turns out to be a non-trivial task for a machine to perform.
In the following chapters we will go into detail about the various models and through experiments and graphs figure out which model will work best to solve this task.
