\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}
The purpose of this project was to discover and work on different neural network models in order to solve an image classification problem. Specifically the recognition of chihuahuas from muffins, which because of the similarities, turns out to be a non-trivial task for a machine to perform.
In Chapter \ref{ch:dataset} we go on to explain what the reference dataset is, how it is loaded, and what the preprocessing operations were. In the Chapter \ref{ch:nnm} we go into the details of the solution by addressing different machine learning models such as MLPs, CNNs, and ResNet50 describing it at the level of technical detail. Chapter \ref{ch:experiments}, on the other hand, is devoted entirely to tables showing the performance of the various models to understand how they performed during the training. Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} there are conclusions that can be extrapolated from the data of the experiments conducted.
