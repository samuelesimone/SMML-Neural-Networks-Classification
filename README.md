# SMML-Neural-Networks-Classification

This repo contains the project for the «Statistical Methods For Machine Learning» course taught at the Master in «Computer Science» at the Università degli Studi di Milano.

The purpose of this project was to discover and work on different neural network models in order to solve an image classification problem (Muffin vs chihuahua).

# Dataset

The projects described in this document refer to the «[Muffin vs chihuahua](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification)» dataset, 
which is published on Kaggle and released under the [CC0 license, Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

# Instructions

There are two folders within the repository.

In the **Project** folder is the Jupyter notebook file

In the **Report** folder, on the other hand, you can find the pdf of the report under the path *Report -> Main -> SMML-Samuele-Simone.pdf*. 

Remember to enter your Kaggle credentials before running the code so that you can download the data.
